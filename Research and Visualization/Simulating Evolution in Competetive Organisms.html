<h1>Simulating Evolution in Competitive Organisms</h1>
<p>This project simulates the population phenotypic dynamics of simplified microbial organisms that compete for resources. I created an extensible framework for simulating bacterial swarming behavior, as described by my team mates Demetrius Dimucci and Jessica Keenan. This project was completed for the course <i>Dynamics and Evolution of Biological Networks</i> taught by Dr. Kiril Korolev and Dr. Daniel Segre
</p>

<p>This population is made up of <b style='color:grey'>producers</b> of a public good (a single limiting factor for metabolism, "Food") at a metabolic cost to themselves, and the <b style='color:red'>consumers</b> that do not produce anything but still use up resources. These organisms are placed in an environment with spatial barriers that segregate the environment into two groups with a small passage between them.
</p>

<p>Bacterial movement models the "tumble and run" pattern observed in <em>E. coli</em>, where random changes in direction occur constantly, but less often in the presences of a nutrient gradient. Food particles move as a random walk. The food particles must undergo some process once secreted (like a siderophore), and are not edible until after a short period of time has passed since they were released.
</p>
Bacteria expend metabolic resources to move, the greater the movement rate, the more energy it costs. For simplicity, bacteria always travel at their full speed. If a bacterium runs out of metabolic energy, it dies, leaving nothing behind.

<p>After a bacterium has built up a large enough food supply, they will reproduce, dividing into two new bacteria, passing on their traits, and allowing mutation to occur. This simple example models two traits, movement rate and food production rate (for producers only). Traits tend towards reduced function, with lower movement rate and slower food production as negative mutations are more common than positive mutations in this simulation. Additionally, each individual has its own genome represented as a short string of nucleotides, which are passed on and may be mutated with each division, allowing you to perform population statistics on the simulation.
