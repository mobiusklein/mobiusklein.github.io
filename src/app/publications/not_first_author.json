    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in high levels of morbidity and mortality world-wide, and severe complications can occur in older populations. Humoral immunity induced by authorized vaccines wanes within 6 months, and frequent boosts may only offer transient protection. GRT-R910 is an investigational self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA)-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine delivering full-length Spike and selected conserved non-Spike T cell epitopes. This study reports interim analyses for a phase I open-label dose-escalation trial evaluating GRT-R910 in previously vaccinated healthy older adults (NCT05148962). Primary endpoints of safety and tolerability were assessed. Most solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) following GRT-R910 dosing were mild to moderate and transient, and no treatment-related serious AEs were observed. The secondary endpoint of immunogenicity was assessed via IgG binding assays, neutralization assays, interferon-gamma ELISpot, and intracellular cytokine staining. Neutralizing antibody titers against ancestral Spike and variants of concern were boosted or induced by GRT-R910 and, contrasting to authorized vaccines, persisted through at least 6 months after the booster dose. GRT-R910 increased and/or broadened functional Spike-specific T cell responses and primed functional T cell responses to conserved non-Spike epitopes. This study is limited due to small sample size, and additional data from ongoing studies will be required to corroborate these interim findings.",

    "abstract": "The sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long, linear polysaccharide chains that are typically found as the glycan portion of proteoglycans. These GAGs are characterized by repeating disaccharide units with variable sulfation and acetylation patterns along the chain. GAG length and modification patterns have profound impacts on growth factor signaling mechanisms central to numerous physiological processes. Electron activated dissociation tandem mass spectrometry is a very effective technique for assigning the structures of GAG saccharides; however, manual interpretation of the resulting complex tandem mass spectra is a difficult and time-consuming process that drives the development of computational methods for accurate and efficient sequencing. We have recently published GAGfinder, the first peak picking and elemental composition assignment algorithm specifically designed for GAG tandem mass spectra. Here, we present GAGrank, a novel network-based method for determining GAG structure using information extracted from tandem mass spectra using GAGfinder. GAGrank is based on Google's PageRank algorithm for ranking websites for search engine output. In particular, it is an implementation of BiRank, an extension of PageRank for bipartite networks. In our implementation, the two partitions comprise every possible sequence for a given GAG composition and the tandem MS fragments found using GAGfinder. Sequences are given a higher ranking if they link to many important fragments. Using the simulated annealing probabilistic optimization technique, we optimized GAGrank's parameters on ten training sequences. We then validated GAGrank's performance on three validation sequences. We also demonstrated GAGrank's ability to sequence isomeric mixtures using two mixtures at five different ratios.",

    "abstract": "The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global pandemic of COVID-19, is an abundant, heavily glycosylated surface protein that plays a key role in receptor binding and host cell fusion, and is the focus of all current vaccine development efforts. Variants of concern are now circulating worldwide that exhibit mutations in the spike protein. Protein sequence and glycosylation variations of the spike may affect viral fitness, antigenicity, and immune evasion. Global surveillance of the virus currently involves genome sequencing, but tracking emerging variants should include quantitative measurement of changes in site-specific glycosylation as well. In this work, we used data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry to quantitatively characterize the five N-linked glycosylation sites of the glycoprotein standard alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as well as the 22 sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that DIA compared favorably to DDA in sensitivity, resulting in more assignments of low-abundance glycopeptides. However, the reproducibility across replicates of DIA-identified glycopeptides was lower than that of DDA, possibly due to the difficulty of reliably assigning low-abundance glycopeptides confidently. The differences in the data acquired between the two methods suggest that DIA outperforms DDA in terms of glycoprotein coverage but that overall performance is a balance of sensitivity, selectivity, and statistical confidence in glycoproteomics. We assert that these analytical and bioinformatics methods for assigning and quantifying glycoforms would benefit the process of tracking viral variants as well as for vaccine development.

    "abstract": "The most straightforward applications of proteomics database searching involve intracellular proteins. Although intracellular gene products number in the thousands, their well-defined post-translational modifications (PTMs) makes database searching practical. By contrast, cell surface and extracellular matrisome proteins pass through the secretory pathway where many become glycosylated, modulating their physicochemical properties, adhesive interactions, and diversifying their functions. Although matrisome proteins number only a few hundred, their high degree of complex glycosylation multiplies the number of theoretical proteoforms by orders of magnitude. Given that extracellular networks that mediate cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions in physiology depend on glycosylation, it is important to characterize the proteomes, glycomes, and glycoproteomes of matrisome molecules that exist in a given biological context. In this review, we summarize proteomics approaches for characterizing matrisome molecules, with an emphasis on applications to brain diseases. We demonstrate the availability of methods that should greatly increase the availability of information on matrisome molecular structure associated with health and disease.",

Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are vectors of choice in gene therapy due to their well-characterized safety and efficacy profiles; however, while gene therapy has been successful in preclinical models of the disease, clinical trials in humans have failed to demonstrate efficacy.\u00a0 Significantly, all primary AAV receptors of the virus are glycans. We thus hypothesize that age related changes in glycan receptors of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (receptor for rAAV2), and/or N-glycans with terminal galactose (receptor for rAAV9) results in poor adeno-associated virus binding in either the striatum or substantia nigra, or both, affecting transduction and gene delivery. To test our hypothesis we analyzed the striatum and substantia nigra for changes in HS, N-glycans and proteomic signatures in young versus aged rat brain striatum and substantia nigra.We observed different brain region-specific HS disaccharide profiles in aged compared to young adult rats for brain region-specific profiles in striatum versus substantia nigra. We observed brain region- and age-specific N-glycan compositional profiles with respect to the terminal galactose units that serve as receptors for AAV9.\u00a0 We also observed brain region-specific changes in protein expression in the aging nigrostriatal pathway.\u00a0 These studies provide insight into age- and brain region-specific changes in glycan receptors and proteome that will inform design of improved viral vectors for PD gene therapy.",

While collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) remains the mainstay of bottom-up analyses, it performs poorly for the middle-down analysis of multiply glycosylated peptides. With improvements in instrumentation, electron-activated dissociation (ExD) modes are becoming increasingly prevalent for proteomics experiments and for the analysis of fragile modifications such as glycosylation. While these methods have been applied for glycopeptide analysis in isolated studies, an organized effort to compare their efficiencies, particularly for analysis of multiply glycosylated peptides (termed here middle-down glycoproteomics), has not been made. We therefore compared the performance of different ExD modes for middle-down glycopeptide analyses. We identified key features among the different dissociation modes and show that increased electron energy and supplemental activation provide the most useful data for middle-down glycopeptide analysis.

GAG length and sulfation patterns impact disease etiology, cellular signaling, and structural support for cells. We and others have demonstrated the usefulness of tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) for assigning the structures of GAG saccharides; however, manual interpretation of tandem mass spectra is time-consuming, so computational methods must be employed. In the proteomics domain, the identification of monoisotopic peaks and charge states relies on algorithms that use averagine, or the average building block of the compound class being analyzed. While these methods perform well for protein and peptide spectra, they perform poorly on GAG tandem mass spectra, due to the fact that a single average building block does not characterize the variable sulfation of GAG disaccharide units. In addition, it is necessary to assign product ion isotope patterns in order to interpret the tandem mass spectra of GAG saccharides. To address these problems, we developed GAGfinder, the first tandem mass spectrum peak finding algorithm developed specifically for GAGs. We define peak finding as assigning experimental isotopic peaks directly to a given product ion composition, as opposed to deconvolution or peak picking, which are terms more accurately describing the existing methods previously mentioned. GAGfinder is a targeted, brute force approach to spectrum analysis that utilizes precursor composition information to generate all theoretical fragments. GAGfinder also performs peak isotope composition annotation, which is typically a subsequent step for averagine-based methods. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD009101.",

Cryptosporidium parvum (studied here) and Cryptosporidium hominis are important causes of diarrhea in infants and immunosuppressed persons. C. parvum vaccine candidates, which are on the surface of sporozoites, include glycoproteins with Ser- and Thr-rich domains (Gp15, Gp40, and Gp900) and a low complexity, acidic protein (Cp23). Here we used mass spectrometry to determine that O-linked GalNAc is present in dense arrays on a glycopeptide with consecutive Ser derived from Gp40 and on glycopeptides with consecutive Thr derived from Gp20, a novel C. parvum glycoprotein with a formula weight of $\\sim$20 kDa. In contrast, the occupied Ser or Thr residues in glycopeptides from Gp15 and Gp900 are isolated from one another. Gly at the N-terminus of Cp23 is N-myristoylated, while Cys, the second amino acid, is S-palmitoylated. In summary, C. parvum O-GalNAc transferases, which are homologs of host enzymes, densely modify arrays of Ser or Thr, as well as isolated Ser and Thr residues on C. parvum vaccine candidates. The N-terminus of an immunodominant antigen has lipid modifications similar to those of host cells and other apicomplexan parasites. Mass spectrometric demonstration here of glycopeptides with O-glycans complements previous identification C. parvum O-GalNAc transferases, lectin binding to vaccine candidates, and human and mouse antibodies binding to glycopeptides.

Patent protection for several LMWH has expired and abbreviated new drug applications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. As a result, reverse engineering of LMWH for biosimilar LMWH has become an active global endeavor. Traditionally, the molecular weight distributions of LMWH preparations have been determined using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with optical detection. Recent advances in liquid chromatography\u2212mass spectrometry methods have enabled exact mass measurements of heparin saccharides roughly up to degree-of-polymerization 20, leaving the high molecular weight half of the LMWH preparation unassigned. We demonstrate a new LC\u2212MS system capable of determining the exact masses of complete LMWH preparations, up to dp30. This system employed an ion suppressor cell to desalt the chromatographic effluent online prior to the electrospray mass spectrometry source. We expect this new capability will impact the ability to define LMWH mixtures favorably. P",

Therefore, combined analysis of glycan micro- and macro-heterogeneity and bioassays will better define the relationships among glycosylation, viral bioactivity and evolution. We present a study that integrates proteomics, glycomics and glycoproteomics of HA before and after adaptation to innate immune system pressure. We combined this information with glycan array and immune lectin binding data to correlate the phenotypic changes with biological activity. Underprocessed glycoforms predominated at the glycosylation sites found to be involved in viral evolution in response to selection pressures and interactions with innate immune-lectins. To understand the structural basis for site-specific glycan microheterogeneity at these sites, we performed structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. We observed that the presence of immature, high-mannose type glycans at a particular site correlated with reduced accessibility to glycan remodeling enzymes. Further, the high mannose glycans at sites implicated in immune lectin recognition were predicted to be capable of forming trimeric interactions with the immune-lectin surfactant protein-D.",

    "abstract": "Despite the publication of several software tools for analysis of glycopeptide tandem mass spectra, there remains a lack of consensus regarding the most effective and appropriate methods. In part, this reflects problems with applying standard methods for proteomics database searching and false discovery rate calculation. While the analysis of small post-translational modifications (PTMs) may be regarded as an extension of proteomics database searching, glycosylation requires specialized approaches. This is because glycans are large and heterogeneous by nature, causing glycopeptides to exist as multiple glycosylated variants. Thus, the mass of the peptide cannot be calculated directly from that of the intact glycopeptide. In addition, the chemical nature of the glycan strongly influences product ion patterns observed for glycopeptides. As a result, glycopeptidomics requires specialized bioinformatics methods. We summarize the recent progress towards a consensus for effective glycopeptide tandem mass spectrometric analysis.",

    "abstract": "Corals and other cnidarians house photosynthetic dinoflagellate symbionts within membrane-bound compartments inside gastrodermal cells. Nutritional interchanges between the partners produce carbohydrates and lipids for metabolism, growth, energy stores, and cellular structures. Although lipids play a central role in the both the energetics and the structural/morphological features of the symbiosis, previous research has primarily focused on the fatty acid and neutral lipid composition of the host and symbiont. In this study we conducted a mass spectrometry-based survey of the lipidomic changes associated with symbiosis in the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida, an important model system for coral symbiosis. Lipid extracts from A. pallida in and out of symbiosis with its symbiont Symbiodinium were prepared and analyzed using negative-ion electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Through this analysis we have identified, by exact mass and collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry (MS/MS), several classes of glycerophospholipids in A. pallida. Several molecular species of di-acyl phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine as well as 1-alkyl, 2-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidycholine were identified. The 1-alkyl, 2-acyl PEs are acid sensitive suggestive that they are plasmalogen PEs possessing a double bond at the 1-position of the alkyl linked chain. In addition, we identified several molecular species of phosphonosphingolipids called ceramide aminoethylphosphonates in anemone lipid extracts by the release of a characteristic negative product ion at m/z 124.014 during MS/MS analysis. Sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), an anionic lipid often found in photosynthetic organisms, was identified as a prominent component of Symbiodinium lipid extracts. A comparison of anemone lipid profiles revealed a subset of lipids that show dramatic differences in abundance when anemones are in the symbiotic state as compared to the non-symbiotic state. The data generated in this analysis will serve as a resource to further investigate the role of lipids in symbiosis between Symbiodinium and A. pallida.",

The Human Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards Initiative in collaboration with several members of the Consortium for Top-Down Proteomics (CTDP) has developed a standard notation called ProForma 2.0, which is a substantial extension of the original ProForma notation developed by the CTDP. ProForma 2.0 aims to unify the representation of proteoforms and peptidoforms. ProForma 2.0 supports use cases needed for bottom-up and middle-/top-down proteomics approaches and allows the encoding of highly modified proteins and peptides using a human- and machine-readable string. ProForma 2.0 can be used to represent protein modifications in a specified or ambiguous location, designated by mass shifts, chemical formulas, or controlled vocabulary terms, including cross-links (natural and chemical) and atomic isotopes. Notational conventions are based on public controlled vocabularies and ontologies.
